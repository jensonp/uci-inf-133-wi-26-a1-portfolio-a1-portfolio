--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 2/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

HTML: 
There is an image of an egg at the bottom of the site that links to a Youtube video. 
There are heading elements <h1>, and <h2> to signify the title, resume, and github link. 
A short <p> element only introduces my name, school, and degree. 
A footer exist at the bottom of the site. 
A flavicon of a vampire exists.


(b) CSS features

The margin, border, and padding of the text elements are modified. 
Link are void of their blue color, and underline appearance.
Hovering over a clickable link creates an animated color transition. 
There is a custom google font, Sansita, as well as a fall back to sans serif. 

(c) Advanced features

A navigation bar at the top of the page links to outgoing social media accounts. 
Using Typed.js, specific text elements appear sequentially in an animated fashion. 
There is a video of a revolving red earth with fallbacks, but only text to show that the video isn't available.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.



4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

At least 20 hours.

5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
